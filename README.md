**California Housing Prices - Machine Learning Project 🏡📊**

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using machine learning techniques. It leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization to achieve high predictive accuracy.

**🔹 Project Overview**
**Objective**: Predict median house values based on housing attributes.

**Dataset**: California housing data from Kaggle

Approach: Implement various ML models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

🔹 **Features & Methodology**

✔ **Data** **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.

✔ **Feature** **Engineering**: Create new features like bedroom ratio & household density.

✔ **Data** **Scaling**: Normalize features using StandardScaler.

✔ **Model** **Training**: Train multiple models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

✔ **Hyperparameter** **Tuning**: Optimize model parameters using GridSearchCV.

✔ **Performance** **Evaluation**: Evaluate models with R² score.
